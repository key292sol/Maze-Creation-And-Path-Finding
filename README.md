# Maze Creation and Path Finding

This is a repository to store the implementations of various maze generation and maze solving algorithms.
It can run using IDE or command line terminal.

The main method can be found in main/Main.java class

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
- Randomized Depth First Search
- Randomized Prim's

## Path Finding Algorithms:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- A* (A-star) path finding

## Notes

### Random Prim's:
I've implemented a modified version of it which uses cells instead of walls.

### A* path finding:
I have implemented 2 ways to calculate cost of cells. I've commented one of those calculating ways. If you want to see it's output then you need to uncomment it.
